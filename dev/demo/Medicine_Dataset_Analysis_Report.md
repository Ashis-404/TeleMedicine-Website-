3. **Consistent Format**: All data fields follow consistent formatting
4. **Balanced Distribution**: Categories are well-balanced
5. **Realistic Values**: Medicine strengths and other attributes appear realistic

### Observations:
1. **Limited Medicine Names**: Only 64 unique names suggest this might be a synthetic/sample dataset
2. **Perfect Balance**: The near-perfect 50/50 split between OTC and prescription drugs is unusually balanced
3. **Even Distribution**: Most categories have very similar counts, which is statistically unusual for real-world data

## Business Insights

### Market Opportunities:
1. **Infection Treatment**: Highest demand category (12.79%)
2. **Mental Health**: Antidepressants represent significant market share (12.71%)
